Generating all possible prompts for a complex schema like the one provided would result in an enormous list. Instead, I'll categorize and provide **examples of prompts** grouped by functionality for each table and its relationships. This will give you a comprehensive starting point to generate a structured dataset.

### **General Categories for Prompts**

1. **Entity Retrieval**:
   - Retrieve basic details of individual entities (e.g., employees, vehicles).
   - List all items in a category (e.g., all projects, all departments).

2. **Filter-Based Queries**:
   - Filter entities based on attributes (e.g., employees with a specific role, vehicles under maintenance).

3. **Relationship-Based Queries**:
   - Queries involving foreign key relationships (e.g., projects under a department, maintenance tasks for a vehicle).

4. **Aggregate Information**:
   - Aggregate operations (e.g., total expenses by department, count of employees in a team).

5. **Complex Relationships**:
   - Multi-table queries involving relationships (e.g., list employees working on active projects).

6. **Historical and Status-Based Queries**:
   - Historical data or status queries (e.g., completed maintenance tasks, past projects).
